# Compile.io MVC Lab - David Gruninger

Date: 9/11/2020 - 9/15/2020

## Part A - Design

### 1. Review your Active Record architecture you made for compile.io

I have linked my Active Record architecture from earlier in the week below.

### 2. Sketch two possible controllers for the provided use case, showing how they interact with your Active Record:

Below is my sketch for Input controller. I used another tool to better represent the model view controller relationship within the presentation layer.

Below is my sketch for Input controller + Application Controller

### 3. Compare the sequence diagrams for the two different controller patterns for the use caseâ€™s Basic Flow.

First of all, it is pretty clear that both designs are essentially doing the same thing; relaying information about the file submission from the MVC down to the domain layer.
However, the input + application controller is also using a separate application controller. Since both architectures are accomplishing the same thing, I think
it makes more sense to use the input controller because we need **one fewer class** within our system. We can communicate with the domain perfectly fine
without an application controller with how the input controller pattern has been set up.

### 4. Pick one of these as "best" and say why.

For the reason described above, I think it makes sense to use the **input controller** as the architectural pattern for this application. In comparing two designs
that accomplish the same task, it is wise to choose the design with **less code**. This means the system will be less complex and require less overall work in the
implementation of the system.

## Part B - Code
